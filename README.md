# lattice-structures
Data cube lattices and concept lattices are two important models for data analysis and knowledge system. They both essentially have lattice structures, which are actually irregular in our real world.

We first tackle the structural statistics of lattice data from three aspects: the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and average path length. We demonstrated by various datasets that data cube lattices and concept lattices share similarities underlying their topology, which are in general different from random networks and complex networks. Specifically, lattice data follow the Poisson distribution and have smaller clustering coefficient and greater average path length. We further discuss and explain these characteristics intrinsically by building the analytical model and the generating mechanism.
